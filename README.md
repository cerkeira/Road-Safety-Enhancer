# Road Safety Enhancer 🚦🏍️

An **affordable blind spot detection system** for motorcyclists, designed to enhance road safety and rider awareness using simple and accessible components.

## 🔧 Components (≈ 45€)

- ESP32 Devkit – ≈ 12€
- Adafruit Neopixel Strip (min. 6 LEDs) – ≈ 16€
- Powerbank – ≈ 10€
- 3× HC-SR04 sensors *(can be replaced by waterproof JSN-SR04T)*
- 3× 1kΩ resistors
- 3× 2.2kΩ resistors
- 1× 470Ω resistor
- 1× 1000µF 6V capacitor
- Jumper wires – ≈ 3€
- 1× Breadboard – ≈ 2€

## 🧰 Materials

For soldering:
- Solder wire, soldering paste, desoldering mesh
- Perforated plate, screws, heat shrink sleeve

## 🛠️ Tools

- Soldering iron
- Small star screwdriver
- 3D printer (for casing)

## 📦 Alternatives

- Use batteries with a voltage regulator instead of a powerbank.
- Use waterproof JSN-SR04T sensors for better durability.
- Power the system from the bike with proper voltage regulation.

## ⚙️ Circuit Assembly

Prototyping is recommended using a breadboard first.

- Each sensor:
  - VCC → ESP32 Vin
  - GND → ESP32 GND
  - TRIG → Digital pin on ESP32
  - ECHO → 1kΩ resistor → ESP32 pin and → 2.2kΩ to GND
- LED strip:
  - DIN → 470Ω resistor → ESP32 pin
  - 5V → capacitor anode → ESP32 Vin
  - GND → capacitor cathode → ESP32 GND
